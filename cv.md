## About Me

My strength is that I am very goal oriented. I love to learn, I love algorithmic problems and I love to work. I love seeing my results. I have experience in school. I worked as a computer science teacher for 3 years, and it was a great time. Although outwardly I look like a very fragile and small girl, I could easily find an approach to students due to my worldview: it’s better to be yourself and give love (But in moderation!)
